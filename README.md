/* I choose the MIT Liscense. The discription on this Liscense is decribed as "simple and permissive"
* My justification are as followed:
* I advocate "free software" as mentioned in Chapter 4 however I understand that there are some flaws with GNU liscense, such as the fact that it is not as user friendly. I wanted my repo to be modified and improved by other programmers however I wanted to protect myself legally if any violated are traced back to me. I choose the MIT permissive liscense because it does not hold me liable to other programmers modifications of my codes.
